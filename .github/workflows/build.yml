The build script uses YAML format to define a workflow named "Build Geode Mod" that runs on workflow_dispatch and push events to any branch. It includes a build job with a matrix strategy for different configurations (Android64 and Android32) using ubuntu-latest as the operating system. The steps involve checking out the code and building the mod using the geode-sdk/build-geode-mod@main action with combine: true and specifying the target. A separate package job depends on the build job, combines the builds using geode-sdk/build-geode-mod/combine@main, and uploads the "Build Output" as an artifact. The full script is available for reference.
